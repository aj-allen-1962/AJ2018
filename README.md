Wordpress theme

This is a simple theme I am working on currently. Objective is to keep theme as lightweight as possible while still giving options for different page layouts, grid or columns, and customizing colors.

Each file is created by me, starting with only  blank index.php and style.css files. While modifying existing themes is fun, and most of the heavy lifting is already done, creating a theme from scratch is far more staisfying, and also more educational. My aim is to gain a deeper understanding of WP and php.
